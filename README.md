# KioskCore

This application would be used to create a kiosk-style environment on a Windows computer. A kiosk is a computer that is set up to run a single application, and users are not allowed to interact with the operating system or any other applications.

The application would work by first checking the desired program to run. If the program is not running, the application would start it. The application when requested then hide the taskbar and disable the ctrl+esc shortcut. This would prevent users from being able to close the application or access the operating system.

The application would also have a checkbox that would allow users to highlight the program when it is checked. This would make the program stand out from other applications on the screen.

Finally, the application would have a timer that would close the kiosk at the specified time. This would prevent users from using the kiosk after the specified time.

####Here are some of the benefits of using this application:

- It would create a secure environment where users cannot access the operating system or other applications.

- It would make it easy to start and stop the desired program.

- It would prevent users from closing the kiosk before the specified time.

####Here are some of the limitations of this application:

- It would only work on Windows computers.

- It would only work with the desired program.

- It would not be able to prevent users from accessing the operating system through other means, such as by restarting the computer.

Overall, this application would be a useful tool for creating a kiosk-style environment on a Windows computer. It would be easy to use and would provide a secure environment for users.
